# Networking Project
The project aims to develop a parallel client/server application to manage university exams. The outline involves the creation of three groups of students, each responsible for a specific part of the application.

# User Manual for Compilation and Execution

## Clone the Repository

To obtain the project's source code, you need to clone the repository from GitHub. Use the following terminal command:

```
 git clone https://github.com/MrPericle/NetworkingProject.git
```
Next, navigate to the newly cloned directory using the command:
```
 cd NetworkingProject
```

## Compilation
The project consists of three distinct executable files: **serverUniversitario**, **segreteria**, and **client**. Each file must be compiled separately, as indicated below:

- **Server Universitario**:
```
 gcc serverUniversitario.c wrapper.c -o serverUniversitario
```
- **Segreteria**:
```
 gcc segreteria.c wrapper.c -o segreteria
```
- **Studente**:
```
 gcc studente.c wrapper.c -o client

```

## Execution
After compilation, run the executables in the following order:

- **Server Universitario**:
```
 ./serverUniversitario
```
- **Segreteria**:
```
 ./segreteria
```
- **Studente**:
```
 ./client
```

## Features
Once the components are started, the university server will remain listening. The main functionalities of the segreteria and student are as follows:

### Segreteria:
1. Inserts exams into the university server.
2. Forwards student reservation requests to the university server.
3. Provides the student with available exam dates for the selected course.

### Student:
1. Asks the segreteria if there are available exams for a specific course.
2. Sends a reservation request for an exam to the segreteria.

## Additional Features
- The university server, for each reservation request, sends the segreteria the sequentially assigned reservation number for the student, and the segreteria forwards it to the student.

- If the segreteria does not respond to the student's request, the student must retry the connection three times. If the requests continue to fail, the student will wait for a random period and try again. This simulates a timeout of the segreteria, testing random wait times.
